# Vanlife

Built with react router 6

## Things to keep in mind

there is no real authentication on the site but a set up one to mimic a log in to access the host pages
email: b@b.com password: p123

I have integrated the app with firebase but netlify doesnt let me build the app so i have commented out the firebase calls
if you want to test the firebase functionality then simply uncomment the api calls and change the loader functions with the get fucntions from the import of firebase 
files to change: Vans.js VanDetails.js HostVans.js HostVanDetail.js Dashboard.js
